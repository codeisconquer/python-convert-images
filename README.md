#Python Convert image files from png to jpg and back



##Installation

I've done this with python 3.7. Should work with older 3.x versions. If you have python 2.x, maybe you get an idea from this code and implement an adaptive solution.

###Modules needed
-pip for installing modules
-glob
-PIL


`pip install glob3`
`pip install Pillow`


##Starting

Pythons pillow modul is very powerful to easyly convert images. Please install all necessary dependencies. 


##Commands
`python convert_jpg2png.py`
`python convert_png2jpg.py`

Tipp: for having example png files, please run first jpg2png
